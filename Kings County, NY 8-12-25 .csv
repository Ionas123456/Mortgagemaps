This legal two-family with a two-car garage spans an impressive 20 feet wide by 64 feet deep, offering approximately 3,390 square feet of space—including a garden rental, and an oversized duplex ready for a FULL RENOVATION.

The home is currently configured as a garden-level two-bedroom apartment, a top floor in original condition with three (3) spacious bedrooms, and a parlor-level space formerly used as a doctor’s office—perfect for reimagining as part of a grand owner’s duplex or income-producing unit.

The house retains its classic red brick façade, with ornamental brickwork above the windows, a covered porch, and a timeless prewar aesthetic. Behind the charm, you’ll find updated mechanicals including a new heating system and water heater—giving you a solid foundation to build on.

The property will be delivered vacant, offering a blank slate for both investors and end-users.

Savvy investors and end users are setting their sights east. Flatbush is quickly becoming the new Bed-Stuy, with a surge of new cafes, restaurants, and cultural spaces emerging along Church Avenue, Flatbush Junction, and Nostrand. You’re just minutes from Brooklyn College, Kings Theatre, and the 2/5 subway lines for easy access to Manhattan.

Originally built in 1899, this masterfully renovated single-family townhouse seamlessly blends historic charm with high-end finishes and contemporary design.

Measuring 20 feet wide, this expansive home offers six bedrooms, four full bathrooms, two powder rooms, a gracious parlor deck, and a lush backyard garden — ideal for stylish entertaining or peaceful retreat.

Enter through a classic entry vestibule into a welcoming foyer, complete with a double coat closet and an interior entry door that leads into the grand parlor level. Here, almost 10-foot ceilings and oversized windows flood the open floor plan with natural light. The living and dining areas flow effortlessly into the chef’s kitchen, which features quartz countertops, custom cabinetry, and a premium appliance suite: an integrated Bosch refrigerator, Wolf six-burner range, Bosch dishwasher, Sharp microwave drawer, and Summit wine cooler. A chic powder room completes the parlor floor.

The upper levels include five spacious bedrooms and three full bathrooms. The serene primary suite overlooks the garden and features three sun-filled windows, a custom walk-through closet, and a luxurious en-suite bath with a freestanding clawfoot tub, double vanity, and marble-tiled shower. The top floor includes three additional bedrooms, two full baths, and washer/dryer.

The garden level serves as a flexible one-bedroom guest suite or private apartment, complete with a living and dining area, kitchenette (featuring a wine cooler, sink, and dishwasher), and a full bath — perfect for extended family, guests, or an au pair.

The finished basement, accessible via the main interior staircase, offers generous space for a home office, playroom, gym, or artist studio, and includes additional storage and a powder room.

Throughout the home, attention to detail is evident — from a built-in sound system and designer lighting to solid wood entry doors and classic millwork. This residence offers a harmonious blend of craftsmanship and modern convenience.

Located on one of Bedford-Stuyvesant’s most beloved blocks, you’ll find yourself surrounded by acclaimed eateries such as Saraghina, Frog, Macosa Trattoria, Corto, Brown Butter Creamery, and Bed-Vyne.

With their classic 1920s construction, solid layouts, and unbeatable location, these buildings present a compelling investment for those seeking long-term value, repositioning potential, or future redevelopment. Each property features a thoughtful unit mix of four spacious 1-bedroom apartments and two well-proportioned 2-bedroom units, providing a balanced blend of marketability and functionality. Several units are currently rented, while others are vacant or owner-occupied — offering significant upside through lease-up, improvements, or condo conversion strategies. Combined, the buildings span approximately 10,500 square feet and sit on three 18.75 x 100 ft lots. With charming residential surroundings and close proximity to Williamsburg’s thriving retail corridors, these properties are ideally suited for savvy investors or end users who are familiar with the operations, regulations, and long-term upside of rent-stabilized buildings. Whether you're looking to unlock under-market rents, stabilize long-term holdings, or explore conversion potential, 234–238 Powers St is a rare chance to acquire scale in one of Brooklyn’s most sought-after neighborhoods.

An extremely rare opportunity to own a home at a price that’s nearly impossible to find in this highly desirable neighborhood.    This move in ready home offers tremendous potential — both inside and out. The property comes with built-in upside: both neighboring houses — identical in layout — have extended in the front and added a second-story rear extension. The same opportunity exists here for the next owner with vision.  Move in, update, expand — or all three. Whatever your plans, the canvas is already in place.

A masterclass in refined Brooklyn living, 18 Arlington Place is a fully renovated historic brownstone that seamlessly marries 19th-century architectural detail with the contemporary comforts today's buyers crave. Nestled on a serene, tree-lined block in prime West Bedford-Stuyvesant adjacent to Clinton Hill, this stately residence boasts grand proportions, impeccable craftsmanship, and a rich palette of period details and modern finishes throughout.

From the moment you step inside, the home's original stone mantels, ornate plasterwork ceilings, pocket doors, and a prominent central staircase speak to its storied past. Yet every space has been reimagined for modern living. The parlor-level chef's kitchen blends historic charm with high-performance design, featuring custom cabinetry, Caesarstone Quartz countertops, period-inspired pendant lighting, and a top-tier appliance suite including a Wolf range and hood, Sub-Zero refrigerator, and Miele dishwasher. Bronze fixtures and gleaming hardwood floors round out this inviting space, ideal for both everyday living and entertaining.

Each bedroom offers a peaceful escape, bathed in natural light from stained glass-crowned windows, while the luxurious en-suite bathrooms evoke a spa-like feel with radiant heated floors, custom black and white tile work, glass-fronted vanities, and carefully curated finishes. Spacious walk-in closets provide generous storage, and the backyard patio and deck offer a private oasis for relaxing or hosting gatherings.

Located on one of Bed-Stuy's most iconic brownstone blocks, 18 Arlington Place is surrounded by a thriving neighborhood rich in history and culture and immediately adjacent to Clinton Hill and Crown Heights. Just moments from Herbert Von King Park, you'll also enjoy easy access to local hotspots like Saraghina, Lun tico, Peaches, and L'Antagoniste, along with everyday conveniences and boutique shopping. Commuting is a breeze with nearby A, C, and G train access, offering quick connections to downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan. This is quintessential brownstone Brooklyn-restored, reimagined, and ready to welcome you home.";"[{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2034-Ps-3-The-Bedford-Village/"",""name"":""Ps 3 The Bedford Village"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Primary"",""grades"":""PK-5"",""rating"":4,""distance"":0.2},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/8390-Satellite-East-Middle-School/"",""name"":""Restoration Academy"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Middle"",""grades"":""6-8"",""rating"":4,""distance"":0.3}]";"[{""date"":""2025-07-08"",""time"":1751932800000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":2895000,""priceChangeRate"":1.517391304347826},{""date"":""2017-05-11"",""time"":1494460800000,""event"":""listingRemoved"",""price"":9495},{""date"":""2017-05-05"",""time"":1493942400000,""event"":""listedForRent"",""price"":9495,""priceChangeRate"":-0.20842017507294705},{""date"":""2015-09-17"",""time"":1442448000000,""event"":""listingRemoved"",""price"":11995},{""date"":""2015-08-16"",""time"":1439683200000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":11995,""priceChangeRate"":0.24688149688149688},{""date"":""2015-08-07"",""time"":1438905600000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":9620,""priceChangeRate"":-0.08337303477846593},{""date"":""2015-07-07"",""time"":1436227200000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":10495,""priceChangeRate"":-0.12505210504376824},{""date"":""2015-05-21"",""time"":1432166400000,""event"":""listedForRent"",""price"":11995},{""date"":""2013-07-09"",""time"":1373328000000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":1150000,""priceChangeRate"":5.96969696969697},{""date"":""1995-05-03"",""time"":799459200000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":165000}]"

Built in 1899 and meticulously re-engineered for 2025, this turn-key luxury home spans 4,000 square feet across three sun-splashed levels, plus a fully finished lower level. Situated on an expansive 50' × 100' lot with an extra-wide 28' façade, this residence offers rare breathing room within city limits.

This stunning home features five serene bedrooms and four-and-a-half bespoke baths, with flawlessly integrated original details throughout a top-to-bottom renovation. The chef’s kitchen is a culinary dream, boasting a Taj Mahal quartzite island, custom white-oak cabinetry, a GE Café induction range, and Fisher Paykel column refrigeration. The primary suite is a sanctuary beneath vaulted, skylit ceilings, complete with a spa bath featuring a freestanding tub, Brizo rain shower, and walnut double vanity.

Four large bedrooms and two designer baths grace the second level, while the lower level flexes as a media lounge, gym, playroom, or home office with a full bath. This home is a move-in-ready historic showpiece, offering every building system and surface brand-new or painstakingly restored.

The property includes a two-car garage and private driveway, an extraordinary amenity south of Prospect Park. The expansive wrap-around porch and landscaped rear garden are crafted for effortless indoor-outdoor entertaining. All-new triple-pane Pella Reserve wood windows, Rockwool insulation, and a 5-zone ducted climate system deliver comfort and energy savings.

Additional features include new electrical, plumbing, CAT-6 wiring, and an exterior camera system. Premium unlacquered brass hardware and bespoke millwork are found throughout. Live Victorian Flatbush at its best, with a 7-minute stroll to Prospect Park Parade Grounds and newly resurfaced tennis courts, and just one block to Cortelyou Road’s vibrant cafes, restaurants, and year-round farmers’ market.";"[{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2465-Ps-139-Alexine-A-Fenty/"",""name"":""Ps 139 Alexine A Fenty"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Primary"",""grades"":""PK-5"",""rating"":6,""distance"":0.2},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/18384-Middle-890/"",""name"":""Middle 890"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Middle"",""grades"":""6-8"",""rating"":7,""distance"":0.5},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/1855-Brooklyn-College-Academy/"",""name"":""Brooklyn College Academy"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""High"",""grades"":""9-12"",""rating"":7,""distance"":0.7}]";"[{""date"":""2025-06-20"",""time"":1750377600000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":3400000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.04895104895104895},{""date"":""2025-06-19"",""time"":1750291200000,""event"":""listingRemoved"",""price"":3575000},{""date"":""2025-05-02"",""time"":1746144000000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":3575000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.029850746268656716},{""date"":""2025-03-26"",""time"":1742947200000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":3685000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.028985507246376812},{""date"":""2025-02-24"",""time"":1740355200000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":3795000,""priceChangeRate"":1.4483870967741936},{""date"":""2024-07-03"",""time"":1719964800000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":1550000},{""date"":""2016-04-06"",""time"":1459900800000,""event"":""listingRemoved"",""price"":2350,""priceChangeRate"":0.11904761904761904},{""date"":""2016-03-04"",""time"":1457049600000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":2100,""priceChangeRate"":-0.10638297872340426},{""date"":""2016-01-12"",""time"":1452556800000,""event"":""listedForRent"",""price"":2350}]"

Presented in comfortable order, it sits in a popular Brooklyn address and offers outstanding potential for a creative redesign or transformation to turn it into a high-performing investment or family home. The interiors are somewhat worn and in need of a modern update, but the original high ceilings and preserved 1920s details still offer a sense of old-world charm. A basement level plus a dual-story residence, there is scope to retain this layout or reconfigure.     There's also a large backyard with a deck and paved patio, plus a private driveway providing off-street parking. It will bring unlimited rewards for those wishing to capitalize on such a convenient neighborhood that's just a few minutes from the L train to Manhattan, with easy access to local shops, schools, parks and the waterfront at Canarsie Pier. An architect could do great things with this property, but it's not beyond the scope of DIY enthusiasts looking to add value through an update or renovation.    Major highlights include: Fully detached 1920s duplex on a large 1,940 sqft block Three-story layout complete with a full basement level Spacious backyard includes a large deck and paved patio A private driveway and off-street parking for two cars Excellent scope to update, renovate and add more value in a well-connected and community-friendly neighborhood Easy access to the waterfront and BJ's Wholesale Club.;"[{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2389-Ps-114-Ryder-Elementary-School/"",""name"":""Ps 114 Ryder Elementary School"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Primary"",""grades"":""PK-5"",""rating"":4,""distance"":0.3},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2254-Is-68-Isaac-Bildersee/"",""name"":""Is 68 Isaac Bildersee"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Middle"",""grades"":""6-8"",""rating"":4,""distance"":0.8},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/13336-Olympus-Academy/"",""name"":""Olympus Academy"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""High"",""grades"":""9-12"",""rating"":2,""distance"":0.5}]";"[{""date"":""2025-07-10"",""time"":1752105600000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":559000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.01757469244288225},{""date"":""2025-06-17"",""time"":1750118400000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":569000,""priceChangeRate"":0.6997759522031367},{""date"":""2006-12-15"",""time"":1166140800000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":334750,""priceChangeRate"":1.9235807860262009},{""date"":""1997-02-19"",""time"":856310400000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":114500}]"

Currently, the house has four bedrooms and three full bathrooms but, as seen on the alternate floor plan, the possibilities to customize the space are endless.

The garden level has been renovated featuring a spacious living/dining with an open kitchen that has direct access to the enormous backyard. It also has a renovated full bathroom on this floor. The parlor level has high ceilings, a fireplace, original parquet floors, and beautiful woodwork surrounding the windows and doorways. Handsome french doors with a transom elegantly divide the space into front and back rooms.

The top two floors have high ceilings, picture rail moldings, and a mix of herringbone and mosaic parquet floors. Oversized windows create bright, cheery rooms with decorative fireplaces, arched doorways, and picture rail moldings. The bathrooms on each floor have been remodeled.

Ideal location adjacent to Stuyvesant Heights, and close to many amazing restaurants and bars. Frog, at one end of the block, has ambient outdoor seating and a great selection of wines. In the other direction, you can find the best coal oven pizza at Saraghina and delicious comfort food at Peaches. While you’re visiting, grab a coffee and browse the selection of books and records at Black Star Vinyl. You’ll be here in a flash if you catch the express A train.

Built in 1829, this house was built in the Federal clapboard style and features Victorian add-ons such as the mansard roof with gingerbread details. 

Originally, this property was owned by Sarah Gracie, daughter of Martha Middagh-Van Nostrand, who named the Brooklyn Heights “Fruit Streets”. The Gracie and Middagh families were well-known in the early years of the New York City luxury real estate market, as evidenced by the Gracie mansion on the Upper East Side, which is now home to the New York City Mayor.

69 Orange Street is situated directly next to the iconic Plymouth Church, which has a long history with the abolitionist movement in the United States. The first preacher at Plymouth church, Henry Ward Beecher, was a prominent and well-known abolitionist who dedicated himself to the cause of freedom. Even Beecher’s sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, was committed, as she was the author of the American Classic and anti-slavery book, Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Henry Ward Beecher’s fame attracted thousands to visit the church, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Abraham Lincoln, and Mark Twain, who walked past 69 Orange Street on their way to the church. Plymouth church was a well-known hub of the Underground Railroad, and legend has it that enslaved people making the journey were taken in and given sanctuary at 69 Orange Street, as one of the house's owners, Henry L. Pratt was the deacon of Plymouth Church during the Beecher years.

Brooklyn Heights is the perfect balance of exciting, fast-paced city life and comfortable suburban relaxation. 69 Orange Street is close to Cadman Plaza and Whitman Park, as well as many great restaurants and shops, and the Brooklyn Bridge and Clark Street subway station.

The property is just two (2) blocks from the G train at Myrtle/Willoughby Station, and three (3) blocks from the J/M trains at Myrtle Avenue, so one can be in downtown Brooklyn or downtown Manhattan in minutes.

This property consists of eight FM apartments and a supers unit. All units are free-market and are not subject to rent control / rent stabilization guidelines for multifamily dwellings four units and above. 194 Vernon Ave was fully gut-renovated in 2013, with all major systems replaced including the heating, plumbing, electrical, roof, and windows.

District stands the enchanting 1221 Albemarle Road.

Built for real estate developer George W. May in 1904 and designed by architect William C. Lauritzen, this 6 bedroom, 3.5 bath Colonial Revival mansion has gracious proportions, a perfect layout, beautifully preserved original detail and has been meticulously restored and renovated to include state-of-the-art mechanical systems and materials for the efficiency, comfort and luxury of a brand-new home.

The covered porch with Ionic columns welcomes you into the open parlor floor, a showcase of restored original detail including parquet floors with varied patterns, decorative moldings and woodwork, a sweeping staircase and elaborate stained-glass windows.

The spacious living room has a bay of 4 windows overlooking the lush Albemarle esplanade and a wood-burning fireplace, while the adjacent library boasts custom built-in bookshelves with a rolling ladder and another fireplace. The living room flows into the dining room accented by a striking Nuura chandelier, where you can host at a table that accommodates 10. Off the dining room is a convenient powder room.

The chef’s kitchen features custom oak cabinetry, Calacatta marble countertops, a farm sink with unlacquered brass fixtures, a huge island with Pietra Cardosa countertop and Castille limestone floors. The appliance suite includes Fisher Paykel induction cooktop and oven, Dacor refrigerator, Miele dishwasher and Sharp microwave. The walk-in pantry offers great storage and there is a breakfast nook.

Beyond the kitchen is a mud room with a door leading to your enclosed outdoor oasis with a bluestone patio for dining and grilling, a side garden with fruit, vegetable and herb beds with automatic irrigation. Beyond the backyard is a two-car garage and driveway for 6 cars.

On the second floor are 4 large, sun-drenched bedrooms, one currently used as a family room. Two bedrooms share a Jack and Jill bath with marble double vanity, glass-enclosed shower, freestanding bathtub and handmade tile. The 4th bedroom has a curved glass window and adjacent full bath. An added bonus is the laundry room with LG washer and dryer, sink, marble countertop and built-in racks.

On the third floor is the Primary Suite with a huge bedroom and seating area, custom walk-in closet and a skylit bathroom with marble double vanity, windowed shower clad in handmade tile, unlacquered brass fixtures, soaking tub, limestone floors and custom sauna. There is also an additional bedroom ideal as an office.

The basement is additional living space occupying the full footprint with high ceilings, windows, backyard access and a half bath.

The landmarked Prospect Park South neighborhood was developed between 1898 and 1920, consisting of 206 freestanding homes, many by noteworthy architects including William Van Alen and Arthur Loomis Harmon. Prospect Park South attracted families lured by the peace and quiet of the ‘suburbs’ and the lifestyle of these ‘estates-in-the-city’. This legacy continues today.

Just two blocks from Prospect Park and dining options on Cortelyou Road and the B & Q Trains. This home offers the chance to own a coveted piece of Brooklyn history.

Entering the owner's unit, you're greeted by soaring ceilings, original architectural details, and an abundance of natural light from three exposures that wrap around the building. This expansive layout offers generously proportioned rooms, extensive storage, and a rare sense of privacy and scale.

The primary suite is privately situated in its own wing, featuring an en-suite bath, ample closet space, and a vast bedroom layout that allows for further customization or storage expansion. On the opposite side of the home, two large secondary bedrooms provide flexibility and comfort, easily accommodating multiple beds if needed. A second full bath, complete with shower/tub combo and in-unit washer/dryer, completes this wing.

At the rear of the home, a thoughtfully divided great room creates a natural flow between the formal living and dining areas. The sun-drenched living room, wrapped in oversized windows, offers peaceful views of the garden, while the dining room-equipped with built-in bookshelves-can serve as a formal entertaining space or a hybrid dining/home office area.

The chef's kitchen is enclosed and outfitted with premium cabinetry, top-tier appliances, and Wolf fixtures, making it as functional as it is beautiful.

An Urban Oasis: The Garden

Head outside to discover an incredible private garden that stretches the full 38-foot width of the building. A true sanctuary, this space is a blank canvas for the aspiring gardener or entertainer and represents a nearly unheard-of luxury in Brooklyn townhouse living.

Income Potential & Investment Highlights

The upper rental units have been meticulously maintained, with substantial upgrades throughout. The building offers:

-Strong rental income from both free market and rent-stabilized units
-Coin-operated laundry for residents, generating additional income
-Designated storage shelves for each unit
-Additional basement space with potential for a home gym, office, or studio
-Bike storage and convenient separate access to the front courtyard

Whether you're seeking an elegant Brooklyn residence with supplemental income, or a strategic investment in a historically significant and high-demand neighborhood, 74-76 Third Place delivers unmatched flexibility and value.

Residential floors will be delivered vacant!!

Welcome to 225 S. 1st Street, a prime opportunity in the heart of Williamsburg. This versatile four-story building is perfect for first-time buyers, savvy investors, or end users looking to create their dream home while generating substantial rental income. Why get trapped in a $3M condo with high monthly maintenance fees and no return on investment, when you can have freedom to control your lifestyle in an entire building with income-producing units that help pay your mortgage?

Currently configured with a ground-floor commercial space and three residential floors above, the building is already income-generating. The well-established restaurant on the ground floor is leased at $6,000/month, and the spacious one-bedroom apartment on the second floor can easily rent for $3,000/month. That’s $9,000/month in passive income from day one.

All three residential floors are vacant and ready to reconfigure to your dreams. Renovate the third and fourth floors into a stunning duplex penthouse with a private roof deck and command $8,000/month in rent–– or take all three floors for a marvelous live/work family residence. Live your ideal lifestyle in a charming building in a great neighborhood and let the restaurant and second-floor tenant cover nearly $9,000 of your monthly expenses with potential to take over the second floor apartment as your family grows.

With low maintenance costs and tremendous upside, 225 S. 1st Street is a truly smart, and more practical choice. You’re not just buying space — you’re investing in your future. Whether you live in the one-bedroom and collect $14,000/month, or occupy the upper floors and collect $9,000/month, or use all three residential floors and get $6000/month from the restaurant, this property gives you flexibility, security, and serious return.

This is your chance to own a piece of Williamsburg with real income, real upside, and real value. Schedule a viewing today and see what smart investing really looks like.";"[{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2075-Ps-17-Henry-D-Woodworth/"",""name"":""Ps 17 Henry D Woodworth"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Primary"",""grades"":""PK-5"",""rating"":4,""distance"":0.2},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2197-Jhs-50-John-D-Wells/"",""name"":""Jhs 50 John D Wells"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Middle"",""grades"":""6-8"",""rating"":8,""distance"":0.1},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/8401-Williamsburg-High-School-For-Architecture-And-Design/"",""name"":""Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""High"",""grades"":""9-12"",""rating"":6,""distance"":0.3}]";"[{""date"":""2025-04-26"",""time"":1745625600000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":2999999}]"
