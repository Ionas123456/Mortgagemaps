135 Lefferts #3B is a spacious one bedroom with a great room that accommodates a generous living room and full dining area. Beyond the dining area, you pass massive closets with a washer/dryer and ample storage space on your way to a gorgeous open kitchen with white stone counters on both sides, a double wide fridge, and a top-of-the-line chef's stove on your way out to your private terrace. The terrace is large enough for a table and chairs and plants with room to spare. Looking out onto a peaceful view of trees and gardens, it is truly an oasis in the big city. 

The primary bedroom is large, with room for a king size bedroom set, and features a huge walk in closet. 

Along with your in unit washer/dryer you have central air and heat fully controllable to set your own liking. 

But wait there's more... In the basement you have your own very large dedicated storage room. (Not a cage or a locker, but a ROOM the size of a small bedroom.) And upstairs just two flights from the apartment is a large shared roof with beautiful views of Manhattan and your new beautiful tree-lined neighborhood. 
 
The neighborhood is officially Bed Stuy, but sits literally ON the border and is across the street from what would be considered Clinton Hill. 

The C train at Franklin Ave is one block away. Also one block away are the endless restaurants, shops, bars and cafes of Fulton Ave. 

135 Lefferts is a small, relaxed, self-managed condo building of only eight units, built in 2012. (Maintenance fees are only $328/month!) There are only two apartments per floor which are across the hall from each other, so you have a lot of privacy and no shared wall. 

This is truly a dream apartment, in the most rapidly appreciating neighborhood in Brooklyn.

This is priced to sell and we expect it will go fast, so contact me for a showing asap!",,
