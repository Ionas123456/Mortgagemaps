Secluded. Stunning.

This oversized 2-bedroom co-op at 80 Winthrop Street is a rare find—no shared walls, no hallway noise, just peace, privacy, and nearly 10-foot ceilings. Tucked behind a private entry hall, Unit L1 feels more like a house than an apartment. The renovated eat-in kitchen is a chef’s dream, featuring natural stone countertops, high-end appliances, soft-close cabinetry, and an oversized fridge. With four generous closets and serene views, this home delivers both style and function in equal measure.

Set within 80 Winthrop Street, a meticulously-maintained, pre-war elevator co-op with live-in super, residents also enjoy two central laundry rooms, bicycle storage, high speed Verizon Fios internet and a manicured courtyard oasis—a tranquil escape from the pulse of the city. Located just moments from Prospect Park, the Q/B & 2/5 train lines, and the best of PLG’s cafes, markets, and boutiques, this home combines classic scale with contemporary style in one of Brooklyn’s most beloved neighborhoods.

The co-op maintains a substantial reserve and has had no assessments for capital projects five years and running – a rather uncommon consideration.

Bathroom is also windowed and includes a stylish combo of white subway wall tiles with gray grout, hexagonal floor tiles, and wood vanities with Carrara marble countertops. Brushed nickel hardware is used throughout, including the kitchen and bath fixtures, in addition to all door-knobs and hinges.

Owners are allowed to install laundry in their units should they so desire. Pet and investor friendly. Parents allowed to buy for their children. Subletting allowed.

Iconic Address. Unreal Views.
Welcome to Residence 25C at One Hanson Place—a sleek, sky-high studio perched on the 25th floor of Brooklyn’s most recognizable landmark. With jaw-dropping, open-sky views of Brooklyn and beyond, this is your chance to own a piece of New York history—without the maintenance of a massive footprint.

Inside, the home features 11-foot ceilings, oversized windows, rich chestnut floors, and a designer kitchen with Viking, Sub-Zero, and Bosch appliances. The luxurious bath includes mosaic stone flooring, Kallista fixtures, and a deep soaking tub. Bonus: in-unit washer/dryer and private deeded storage included.

This is a smart, sun-filled studio that delivers big on lifestyle and location. Residents of One Hanson enjoy a full service lifestyle—24-hour concierge, a stunning Art Deco lobby, resident terraces, fitness center, playroom, and conference lounge—all in a building that defines Brooklyn’s skyline.

Why One Hanson Place Is Flat-Out Unbeatable
You’re not just buying a home. You’re buying into the beating heart of Brooklyn—at the junction of Fort Greene, Boerum Hill, and Park Slope.

Transit? Unmatched.
The 2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, N, Q, R, C and G trains plus the LIRR at Atlantic Terminal are literally downstairs. That’s 11 subway lines + Long Island Rail Road at your doorstep. Go anywhere. Fast.

Culture? World-class.
One block from BAM, Barclays Center, Theatre for a New Audience, Mark Morris Dance, and BRIC Arts Media—this is Brooklyn’s cultural core.

Shops + Dining? Endless.
Across the street from Whole Foods, Apple Store, Target, and a few minutes away from Trader Joe’s, with unbeatable eats like Miss Ada, The Commodore, Walter’s, and Maison May minutes away. Fort Greene Park and its weekend greenmarket are nearby, along with leafy streets full of local gems.

Bottom Line?
25C at One Hanson Place delivers luxury, location, and legacy—all in one iconic package. Come see the views. Stay for the lifestyle.";"[{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2149-Ps-38-The-Pacific/"",""name"":""Ps 38 The Pacific"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Primary"",""grades"":""PK-5"",""rating"":7,""distance"":0.3},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/7716-The-Math-And-Science-Exploratory-School/"",""name"":""The Math And Science Exploratory School"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Middle"",""grades"":""6-8"",""rating"":8,""distance"":0.2},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/8940-Khalil-Gibran-International-Academy/"",""name"":""Khalil Gibran International Academy"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""High"",""grades"":""9-12"",""rating"":1,""distance"":0.1}]";"[{""date"":""2025-07-21"",""time"":1753056000000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":699000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.029166666666666667},{""date"":""2025-06-28"",""time"":1751068800000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":720000,""priceChangeRate"":0.2020033388981636},{""date"":""2015-09-16"",""time"":1442361600000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":599000,""priceChangeRate"":0.6233062330623306},{""date"":""2010-04-19"",""time"":1271635200000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":369000}]"

The new bathroom is paneled with subway tiles. Plentiful ambient light keeps this home bright throughout the day, and there are skyline views of downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan from all this home's rooms so even though you're living in a quiet neighborhood you feel connected to the cityscape of New York.

130 8th Avenue is a full service co-op situated in the most beautiful and historic part of Park Slope. It has a doorman, live-in super, 24 hour laundry, bike room, additional storage, and even a garage in the building. Subletting and pieds-a- terre are allowed.

There is an assessment of $287.76 in place for Apt. 6E until December 2026.

One of the BEST parts of living here is that you're just one block from Prospect Park, one of New York's most beautiful green spaces. You're just a block away from all of Park Slope's great shops and restaurants on 7th Avenue. The famous food co-op is close by, as is the farmers market in Grand Army Plaza.
