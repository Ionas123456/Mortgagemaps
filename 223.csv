Originally built in 1947 and thoughtfully converted into condominiums in 2003, this distinctive factory conversion blends historic charm with modern loft living.

Spanning approximately 1,000 square feet, Residence 2E is a true artist’s loft. As you step inside, you're immediately struck by the dramatic scale of the space—soaring nearly 13-foot ceilings and an expansive 20’ x 20’ open living and dining area creating an inspiring and airy atmosphere. Floor-to-ceiling, south-facing windows flood the home with natural light and offer vibrant views of Myrtle Avenue, while  hardwood floors flow seamlessly throughout, adding warmth and character.

At the heart of the home lies a generously sized chef’s kitchen, perfectly positioned between the living space and lofted bedroom. It offers ample cabinetry, abundant counter space, and the ideal layout for entertaining or everyday cooking.

The lofted sleeping area is quintessential Brooklyn—distinctive, spacious, and full of personality. It comfortably fits a king-sized bed and includes plentiful storage, further enhancing the home’s functionality and charm.

The Chocolate Factory introduced Brooklyn’s first green roof-a unique 5000 sqft. tranquil garden space with panoramic views of Manhattan and Brooklyn plus a rooftop atrium gym. There’s 24/7 video security and high-speed Verizon Fios internet included in the building’s common charges. Wifi is also available to all residents on the roof if you prefer to work outside.

This oversized 2-bedroom co-op at 80 Winthrop Street is a rare find—no shared walls, no hallway noise, just peace, privacy, and nearly 10-foot ceilings. Tucked behind a private entry hall, Unit L1 feels more like a house than an apartment. The renovated eat-in kitchen is a chef’s dream, featuring natural stone countertops, high-end appliances, soft-close cabinetry, and an oversized fridge. With four generous closets and serene views, this home delivers both style and function in equal measure.

Set within 80 Winthrop Street, a meticulously-maintained, pre-war elevator co-op with live-in super, residents also enjoy two central laundry rooms, bicycle storage, high speed Verizon Fios internet and a manicured courtyard oasis—a tranquil escape from the pulse of the city. Located just moments from Prospect Park, the Q/B & 2/5 train lines, and the best of PLG’s cafes, markets, and boutiques, this home combines classic scale with contemporary style in one of Brooklyn’s most beloved neighborhoods.

The co-op maintains a substantial reserve and has had no assessments for capital projects five years and running – a rather uncommon consideration.

Why One Hanson Place Is Flat-Out Unbeatable
You’re not just buying a home. You’re buying into the beating heart of Brooklyn—at the junction of Fort Greene, Boerum Hill, and Park Slope.

Transit? Unmatched.
The 2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, N, Q, R, C and G trains plus the LIRR at Atlantic Terminal are literally downstairs. That’s 11 subway lines + Long Island Rail Road at your doorstep. Go anywhere. Fast.

Culture? World-class.
One block from BAM, Barclays Center, Theatre for a New Audience, Mark Morris Dance, and BRIC Arts Media—this is Brooklyn’s cultural core.

Shops + Dining? Endless.
Across the street from Whole Foods, Apple Store, Target, and a few minutes away from Trader Joe’s, with unbeatable eats like Miss Ada, The Commodore, Walter’s, and Maison May minutes away. Fort Greene Park and its weekend greenmarket are nearby, along with leafy streets full of local gems.

Bottom Line?
25C at One Hanson Place delivers luxury, location, and legacy—all in one iconic package. Come see the views.

135 Lefferts #3B is a spacious one bedroom with a great room that accommodates a generous living room and full dining area. Beyond the dining area, you pass massive closets with a washer/dryer and ample storage space on your way to a gorgeous open kitchen with white stone counters on both sides, a double wide fridge, and a top-of-the-line chef's stove on your way out to your private terrace. The terrace is large enough for a table and chairs and plants with room to spare. Looking out onto a peaceful view of trees and gardens, it is truly an oasis in the big city. 

The primary bedroom is large, with room for a king size bedroom set, and features a huge walk in closet. 

Along with your in unit washer/dryer you have central air and heat fully controllable to set your own liking. 

But wait there's more... In the basement you have your own very large dedicated storage room. (Not a cage or a locker, but a ROOM the size of a small bedroom.) And upstairs just two flights from the apartment is a large shared roof with beautiful views of Manhattan and your new beautiful tree-lined neighborhood. 
 
The neighborhood is officially Bed Stuy, but sits literally ON the border and is across the street from what would be considered Clinton Hill. 

The C train at Franklin Ave is one block away. Also one block away are the endless restaurants, shops, bars and cafes of Fulton Ave. 

135 Lefferts is a small, relaxed, self-managed condo building of only eight units, built in 2012. (Maintenance fees are only $328/month!) There are only two apartments per floor which are across the hall from each other, so you have a lot of privacy and no shared wall. 

This is truly a dream apartment, in the most rapidly appreciating neighborhood in Brooklyn.

This is priced to sell and we expect it will go fast, so contact me for a showing asap!";"[{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/2034-Ps-3-The-Bedford-Village/"",""name"":""Ps 3 The Bedford Village"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Primary"",""grades"":""PK-5"",""rating"":4,""distance"":0.2},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/14205-Urban-Assembly-Unison-School-The/"",""name"":""Urban Assembly Unison School (The)"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""Middle"",""grades"":""6-8"",""rating"":4,""distance"":0.3},{""link"":""https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/brooklyn/18877-GOTHAM-PROFESSIONAL-ARTS-ACADEMY/"",""name"":""GOTHAM PROFESSIONAL ARTS ACADEMY"",""type"":""Public"",""level"":""High"",""grades"":""9-12"",""rating"":3,""distance"":0.3}]";"[{""date"":""2025-07-04"",""time"":1751587200000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":799000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.0533175355450237},{""date"":""2025-06-04"",""time"":1748995200000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":844000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.001183431952662722},{""date"":""2025-05-02"",""time"":1746144000000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":845000,""priceChangeRate"":0.024242424242424242},{""date"":""2024-07-08"",""time"":1720396800000,""event"":""listingRemoved"",""price"":825000},{""date"":""2024-06-30"",""time"":1719705600000,""event"":""listingRemoved""},{""date"":""2024-06-22"",""time"":1719014400000,""event"":""listedForRent"",""price"":3500,""priceChangeRate"":0.20689655172413793},{""date"":""2024-06-02"",""time"":1717286400000,""event"":""priceChange"",""price"":825000,""priceChangeRate"":-0.0782122905027933},{""date"":""2024-04-25"",""time"":1714003200000,""event"":""listedForSale"",""price"":895000,""priceChangeRate"":0.30656934306569344},{""date"":""2020-08-31"",""time"":1598832000000,""event"":""listingRemoved"",""price"":2900},{""date"":""2020-08-07"",""time"":1596758400000,""event"":""listedForRent"",""price"":2900},{""date"":""2015-12-03"",""time"":1449100800000,""event"":""sold"",""price"":685000}]"

The building features indoor parking spaces for sale ($100K each) with 220EV charging available for every space, a common roof deck, a resident lounge and workspace, a fitness center, and every single unit comes with a storage unit in the basement. Just a few blocks away you can enjoy glorious Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, and incredible restaurants and amenities in every direction, including the world-famous dining on Vanderbilt Avenue.

Unit 101 is an oversized one-bedroom with soaring ceilings, incredible closets and storage, and also includes an oversized kitchen with an unexpectedly large pantry and a loft-like living space perfect for living AND dining.

Truly distinguished on the outside by its corner location and a stunning facade rendered in white Danish-modern brick, accompanied by stylish bronze frames surrounding oversized windows, designed by IMC Architecture. This rich design tradition resonates throughout the interiors as well through a carefully curated array of natural stones, custom millwork, professional appliances, and jewel-like hardware, created by Studio SC. These are condos that must be seen in person to appreciate the attention to every detail employed throughout.

Soaring 10' minimum ceiling heights and oversized windows are the defining characteristics of these light-filled homes. The corner orientation assures that almost every unit has multiple exposures, and this is most evident in the open plan living and dining rooms. Kitchens have been carefully crafted to include maximum storage and pantry space within custom floor-to-ceiling oak and lacquer cabinetry, paneled appliances including a Fisher-Paykel fridge, Beko Dishwasher, a Bosch gas cooktop & convection oven, and striking terracotta backsplashes and natural quartz countertops. These do not live like your average cookie-cutter apartments. Primary bathrooms are awash in Calacatta Gold marble mosaics with glass-enclosed walk-in showers that include custom storage niches and are complemented by large vanities and oversized decorative mirrors. The secondary baths are equally impressive with handmade terracotta tiles, great lighting, and oversized niches in the tub areas. Oil-rubbed bronze fixtures add a handcrafted touch to the timeless elegance seen throughout these wonderful spaces.

The same impressive, lush and modern aesthetic employed throughout the apartments also welcome you home every day into an impressive double-height lobby with Terrazzo floors, built-in seating, and a large package room. The Resident Lounge on this floor offers wonderful light through its corner location and includes comfortable modern furnishings, custom millwork, and large tables for working from home. Head downstairs into the wonderfully appointed fitness center that feels like a professional gym. A storage room for every unit is also located in the cellar for easy access. A common roof deck offers plantings, furniture, and an outdoor kitchen with a panoramic view of the Brooklyn skyline.
